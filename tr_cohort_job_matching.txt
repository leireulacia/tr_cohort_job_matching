// The purpose of the programme is to get a percentage of matching betweeen 2 lists. One list of the job charasterictics 
//and the other of the individual skills/characteristics. 100  is the ideal match and 0 indicates do NOT show this person that job.
// I use my java knoweldge as base for the exercise. 

// Define variables

jobSkillsArray: String array to save the job characteristics 
jobCohortSkillsList: String array to save the cohort skills
jobCohortSkillsFile: file to save the cohort file
totalskillsMatch: Integer to count the amount of skills in common between the 2 lists
finalpercentage: Integer to save the result of the matching skills percentage

// Greeting to the app
METHOD WELCOME
{
	Print greeting 	
		"Hello! Welcome to the matching job App. This app help you to know how much the cohort fits to the job "
	Print prompt
		press "Enter" to continue 
		<user presses "Enter">
}


//This method ask to introduce to the user the characteristics for the job and save them in an array.
METHOD JOBCHARACTERISTICS
{
	Print promt
		"Please, introduce the job characteristics you would like to looking for. Please, enter # when you finish:"

	DO Take the new characteristic and add to right position of the 'jobSkillsArray' variable
	Reapeat the process WHILE the user introduce symbol "#"
	
}

// This method give 2 options: Introduce a list of individual skills or attach the txt file of the cohort. I could explore to add 
// different kinds of file (not only txt) in the future.

METHOD PersonalSkills
{
	print call-to-action
		"Now it is time to add the details of the COHORT!! Please, press 1 if you prefer to enter a list of skills or 2 if you prefer to use a txt file:"

// I would use a SWITCH statement but now, I consider it is easier to explain with IF statement.

	IF the user press option "1" 
		Print prompt
			"Ok! Here we go! Introduce the list of the Cohort skills. Please, enter # when you finish"

			DO Take the new characteristic and add to right position of the 'jobCohortSkillsList' variable
			Reapeat the process WHILE the user introduce symbol "#"

		GO to method 'CompareList'

	IF the user press option "2"
		Print prompt
			"Perfect! Here we go! Please upload the txt file."

			Take the file and add to the file variable 'jobCohortSkillsFile'

		GO to method 'CompareFile'

METHOD CompareList
{
	//This method check if the first element in the array 'jobSkillsArray' is in any of the positions of the 'jobCohortSkillsList' array. If yes, +1 to the variable 'totalskillsMatch'.

	GO TO method CalculatePercentage

METHOD CompareFile

	// Repeat the same process until the last 'jobSkillsArray' position

}


// This method calculate the matching percentage between the job skills looking for and individual skills.
METHOD CalculatePercentage
{

// This method print the final result to the user
METHOD getResults
{
	Print prompt
		"Regarding the details you introduce. The Cohort skills match in: "+ finalpercentage + " % to the skills you are looking for."
		"Thanks for using the app!"
}


// As an extension of the app, I'd add new funtionality as introduce more cohort details at the same time, given each an individual id and showing a sorted list
//  from the best matching to the less matching cohort.  I'd also add the funtionality to start again after finishing.
